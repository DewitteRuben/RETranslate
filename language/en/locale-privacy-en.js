                    <p>When you use Record Evolution services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Statement is meant to help you understand what information we collect, how we collect it, what we do with it and how we protect this information. Any personal data is collected and processed in accordance with German and EU data protection laws. We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes.</p>
                    <h3><strong>A. Definitions</strong></h3>
                    <p>For the purposes of this privacy statement terms used throughout the document are to be understood as they are defined in the Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and implementing acts in Federal Republic of Germany (e.g., German Federal Data Protection Act Section 3 “Further Definitions”).</p>
                    <p>However, some definitions have to be explicitly stated in the context of Record Evolution Services:</p>
                    <p>1. “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</p>
                    <p>2. “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</p>
                    <p>3. “personal data breach” means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. More detailed information regarding the security measures taken to protect user's data is provided in Record Evolution Security Statement.</p>
                    <h3><strong>B. What information Record Evolution collects and why</strong></h3>
                    <p>We collect personal details from you together with information we learn about you from your use of our website and services. These details may include:
                        <li>first name</li>
                        <li>last name</li>
                        <li>email</li>
                        <li>country</li>
                        <li>address</li>
                        <p>Payment Information: We use a third party payment platform Stripe to process credit and debit card transactions. Stripe has been audited by an independent PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and is certified as a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. All transaction information passed to Stripe's system is encrypted. No cardholder information is ever saved in our datatabase.</p>
                        <p>If you are <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This information we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use Record Evolution, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>
                        <p>If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information." "User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service. Additionally we also save your computer’s IP address and browser settings. The IP address is the numerical address of the computer used to visit the Website. Browser settings can include the type of browser you use, browser language, and time zone. We collect this information so that we can trace the computer used in cases of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with visits to or use of the Website.</p>
                        <h3><strong>C. Data usage purposes:</strong></h3>
                        <p>Your data is used explicitly for following purposes:</p>

                        <p>We will not use your personal information to contact you for marketing purposes without your explicit consent which you can revoke at any time.</p>
                        <h3><strong>D. Data access</strong></h3>
                        <p>Record Evolution guarantees that the user has the right to obtain confirmation whether or not personal data concerning the user is being processed, where and for what purposes. Upon user’s request, Record Evolution will provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in electronic format. User has to provide a detailed description of the type of the personal data he or she would like to get information about.</p>
                        <h3><strong>E. Data breach</strong></h3>
                        <p>In the case of a personal data breach, Record Evolution shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the competent supervisory authority, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the user.</p>
                        <h3><strong>F. Sharing information about you</strong></h3>
                        <p>We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of customers information. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Record Evolution. We may only pass your information on to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements. Record Evolution may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Record Evolution strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested. We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>
                        <h3><strong>G. Public information on Record Evolution</strong></h3>
                        <p>Much of Record Evolution is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Record Evolution information. Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Record Evolution data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of Record Evolution data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile. If you would like to compile Record Evolution data, you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a Record Evolution user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Record Evolution, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Record Evolution or Record Evolution users. Information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services. You can delete your account any time.</p>
                        <p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers,genetic data, health information, or religious information. If you store any sensitive personal information on our platform, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our platform. We do not take any responsibility for the usage of such data. If your account is public, anyone (including us) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public data, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
                        <p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children. Accordingly, children under 16 will not be permitted to open a Record Evolution account. We will delete any Record Evolution account created by a child under 16, as soon as we learn about it.</p>
                        <h3><strong>H. Cookies</strong></h3>
                        <p>This site uses cookies to enable us to improve our service to you and to provide certain features that you may find useful.

We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Record Evolution.

                        <h3><strong>I. Resolving Complaints</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you have concerns about the way Record Evolution is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us directly at
                            <span class="email"><strong><a href="mailto:info@record-evolution.de?subject=Reaching out to RECORD.evolution&body=Hello">info@record-evolution.de</a></strong></span> with the subject line "Privacy Concerns." In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Record Evolution regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, general German legislation applies. How you can access and control the information we collect If you're already a Record Evolution user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile. You also have the right to request correction of any inaccuracies in your personal data or, where appropriate, the erasure of such data. For this purpose, you must provide the following documents: A signed request; A copy of your passport or national ID, so that we can verify your identity; A signed authority from any third party whose data you request on their behalf.</p>
                        <h3><strong>J. Data Retention, Correction, Deletion and Blocking</strong></h3>
                        <p>Record Evolution will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days. Record Evolution takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>
                        <p>Upon user’s request, Record Evolution will make corrections on inaccurate personal data.</p>
                        <p>In the cases where data deletion is not possible due to objective reasons as required by law (e.g., part 3 and 4 of Section 35 of Federal Data Protection Act), instead of erasure personal data shall be blocked.</p>
                        <h3><strong>K. How we communicate with you</strong></h3>
                        <p>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. You have control over how your email address is used and shared on and through Record Evolution. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile. Depending on your email settings, Record Evolution may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a data pod you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support.</p>
                        <h3><strong>L. Changes to our Privacy Statement</strong></h3>
