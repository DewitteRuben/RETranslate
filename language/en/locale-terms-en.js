                    <h3>B. Account Terms</h3>
                    <p>Short version: <i>A human must create your account; you must be 16 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</i></p>
                    <h4>1. Required Information</h4>
                    <p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>
                    <h4>2. Account Requirements</h4>
                    <p>These simple rules apply for accounts on Record Evolution's Service:</p>
                    <p>2.1 You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:</p>
                    <p>2.2 A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.</p>
                    <p>2.3 One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine.</p>
                    <p>2.4 Record Evolution does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to create a User account. If we learn of any such user under the age of 16, we will terminate that User’s account immediately.</p>
                    <p>2.5 Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</p>
                    <p>2.6 Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.</p>
                    <h4>3. User Account Security</h4>
                    <p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.</p>
                    <p>3.1 You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p>
                    <p>3.2 You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Record Evolution cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
                    <p>3.3 You will promptly notify Record Evolution if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
                    <h4>4. Additional Terms</h4>
                    <p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Record Evolution. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Record Evolution with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with our Services. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>
                    <h3>C. Payment</h3>
                    <p>Short version: <i>You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of Record Evolution. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.</i></p>
                    <h4>1. Free Services</h4>
                    <p>Certain Services are provided to User without charge as applicable. We do not guarantee the availability of Free Services at any time.</p>
                    <h4>2. Purchases</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to purchase any product made available through the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your billing address. To process the payments Record Evolution uses only certified payment system providers. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change
                        at the end of a payment term.</p>
                    <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>

                    <p>2.3 You will provide valid and automatically chargeable billing details during the time you use payable service and until all payment obligations by you are met.</p>
                    <p>2.4 By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Purchases.</p>
                    <p>2.5 We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for certain reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>
                    <p>2.6 We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>
                    <h4>3. Product Pricing</h4>
                    <p>We currently offer two pricing models for our Services (Pods):</p>
                    <p>3.1 Resource (i.e. CPU, Memory, Storage, Network) consumption by Users used under the Usage based Pricing Model („Usage Based“) are metered under the below mentioned metering policies and billed to the User as metered.</p>
                    <p>3.2 The user may purchase resource packages over a subscription time range at a fixed price („Flat Based“). Network resources used in excess of the amount included in a Flat Based product are metered according to the same conditions as a usage based product. The purchased resource package is non refundable wether or not the resources are used by User. At the end of each subscription time range, your „Flat Based“ resources package will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Record Evolution cancels it. You may cancel your „Flat Based" subscription renewal through your online account management page.</p>
                    <p>Resource usage for usage based invoicing is metered according to the following metering policy:</p>
                    <p>3.3 Resource Minutes are metered on the full minute rounding up to the next largest integer.</p>
                    <p>3.4 Memory is metered by full Megabyte rounding up to the next largest integer. (1 Megabyte = 1024 bytes).</p>
                    <p>3.5 Persistent Storage is metered by 0.1 Gigabyte rounding up to the next first decimal. (1 Gigabyte = 1024 Megabyte)</p>
                    <p>3.6 CPU is metered by 0.1 CPU Core as offered by Cloud Services Providers (rounding up to the next first decimal).</p>
                    <p>3.7 Network usage is metered by full Megabyte rounding up to the next largest integer.</p>
                    <p>The minimum charge for the usage of each resource for each data pod per month is 0.01€.</p>
                    <p>The current prices and products are displayed on the repods.io home page.</p>
                    <h4>4. Change of Product</h4>
                    <p>You can change the product of a Data Pod at any time. Due Subscription fees for a product before product change will not be refunded. In case you change into a product which had been active before and the subscription period is not yet expired then the next due subscription period will begin after the expiry of the current subscription period.</p>
                    <h4>5. Authorization</h4>
                    <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for Record Evolution.</p>
                    <h4>6. Responsibility for Payment</h4>
                    <p>You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay Record Evolution any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us directly via email <span class="email"><a href="mailto:contact@record-evolution.de?subject=Reaching out to RECORD.evolution&body=Hello">contact@record-evolution.de</a>. </span>You are responsible for providing us with a valid
                        means of payment for paid accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide payment information.</p>
                    <h4>7. Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h4>
                    <p>We are constantly updating our offerings of products and services on the Service. The products or services available on our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites.</p>
                    <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>
                    <h4>8. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h4>
                    <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the Promotion rules will apply.
                    </p>
                    <h4>9. Online Billing</h4>
                    <p>At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period, Record Evolution will issue an electronic bill to User for all charges accrued based on the Usage Based and Flat Based products that were used within this period.</p>
                    <p>If User elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Record Evolution will charge (and User will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If User elects to pay by invoice (and Record Evolution agrees), all Fees are due as set forth in the invoice. User’s obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable.</p>
                    <p>The minimum charge per Credit Card transaction is 0.50€. If no charges accrued (invoice amount of zero Euro) then no Credit Card transaction will be made.</p>                    
                    <p>Record Evolution's measurement of User’s use of the Services is final. Record Evolution has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Record Evolution.</p>
                    <h4>10. Taxes</h4>
                    <p>User is responsible for any Taxes, and User will pay Record Evolution for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Record Evolution is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to User, unless User provides Record Evolution with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. </p>
                    <p>In some regions the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If User is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Record Evolution, User must provide Record Evolution with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject to local VAT and the User is required to make a withholding of local
                        VAT from amounts payable to Record Evolution, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be increased (grossed up) by the User for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed up amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the User and User will ensure that Record Evolution will receive payment for its services for the net amount as
                        would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to applicable tax authority).</p>
                    <p>If required under applicable law, User will provide Record Evolution with applicable tax identification information that Record Evolution may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. User will be liable to pay (or reimburse Record Evolution for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the User.</p>
                    <h4>11. Invoice Disputes and Refunds</h4>
                    <p>Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Record Evolution, Record Evolution will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Record Evolution will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and User will be responsible for paying the resulting net
                        balance due on that invoice.</p>
                    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, User waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any User rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Record Evolution and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Record Evolution to extend credit to any party.</p>
                    <h4>12. Delinquent Payments; Suspension.</h4>
                    <p>Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. User will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Record Evolution in collecting such delinquent amounts. If User is late on payment for the Services, Record Evolution may suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach pursuant to Section.</p>
                    <p>No Purchase Order Number Required. For clarity, User is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Record Evolution to provide a purchase order number on Record Evolution’s invoice (or otherwise).</p>
                    <h3>D. Acceptable Use</h3>
                    <p>Short version: <i>Record Evolution hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith.

                    <h4>5. Scraping</h4>
                    <p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Record Evolution's API. Please see Section I for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Record Evolution must comply with the Record Evolution Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the Record Evolution Privacy Statement). If you collect any Record Evolution User's Personal Information from Record Evolution, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the
                        purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Record Evolution, and you will respond promptly to complaints removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Record Evolution or Record Evolution Users.</p>
                    <h3>E. User-Generated Content</h3>
                    <p>Short version: <i>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</i></p>

You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.

                    <h4>4. License Grant to Us</h4>
                    <p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our platform; share it with other users; and perform it, in
                        case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>
                    <p>This license does not grant Record Evolution the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>
                    <h4>5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>
                    <p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control.</p>
                    <p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Record Evolution a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Record Evolution Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Record Evolution as permitted through Record Evolution's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for
                        ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Record Evolution Users.</p>
                    <h4>6. Contributions Under Data Pod License</h4>
                    <p>Whenever you make a contribution to a Data Pod containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p>
                    <h4>7. Moral Rights</h4>
                    <p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section E.4, but not otherwise.</p>
                    <p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Record Evolution the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>
